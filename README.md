# Org Chart Builder

## Description

The user is to answer command line prompts. These prompts will be about who is on the user's team, or a team they are building. The application will take these answers and dynamically create a team HTML page showing who is on the team. It will show their names, email addresses, position, and office number or github username or the school they are attending.
